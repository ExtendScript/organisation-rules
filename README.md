# organisation-rules
These are some rules how we should behave in our Org and what could happen here.

## Code of Conduct  

Members should read and behave as stated in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Not doing so will result in the removal of that person from the organisation.  

## Members and Owners  

Everybody can become an owner. Being an owner means to contribute actively to the organisation. By maintaining a project, forking interesting projects into the Org, working on the awesome list or whatnot (correcting my typos is for example a sisyphus work).  
If you just want to sit back, relax and watch the chaos you should be a member. It is great to have lots of members. Having a large org will give us more input even if you just contribute with a simple +1 on some random comment on an issue or you tell your mom - it was worth it. To apply to the Org you can write an e-mail to <hello@extendscript.org> or you can use the public [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ExtendScript/agora).  


## Forking and Transferring Projects  

If you have a ExtendScript project you want to transfer to the Org or you found a nice tool somebody wrote and you want to fork it, you are very welcome. These projects should meet a minimal standard:  

- It should work
- It should have a README.md that explains how to use it
- It should have a license

There are lots of repos on GitHub that are called "indesign scripts" or "after effects snippets". But without a good table of content they are useless. If you encounter something like that and still think it is worth to be forked to the Org you should change the name of the repo. It needs a unique name. For example if the user "teddybear" has a repo called "indesign-snippets" it should be named "teddybear-indesign-scripts". So the naming convention should be:  

    [GITHUB USER NAME]-[APPLICATION]-[SCRIPTS]

## Awesome list  

The [awesome list](https://github.com/ExtendScript/awesome) should be really about awesome projects. Not just to promote something that is just mediocre. You are the judge of that.  

## Wiki  

There is this [Wiki](https://github.com/ExtendScript/wiki/wiki) where lots of examples can be found. The aim of the articles should be to show the usage of features. This means:  

- Don't add too much eye candy it will only distract the reader  
- Try to write comments (for every line) or explain your article step by step  
- Use Markdown  
- use [Pygments](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki#syntax-highlighted-code-blocks) code highlighting (` ```js NEWLINE some code NEWLINE``` `)  
- Add your article to the "_Sidebar.md" file  
- Sort the articles by application and alphabetically in the _Sidebar
- Read a bit about the wiki system called [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki)
