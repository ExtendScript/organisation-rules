# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering to contribute and donate your time to our projects.  This guide outlines how to contribute in a way that is efficient for everyone. All contributions are welcome.

## Submitting a pull request

We have adopted [GitHub flow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) way of working.

  * Fork project into your personal space
  * Create a feuture branch away from the master
  * Write tests and code
  * Generate changelog entry where applicable
  * If you have multiple commits please combine them into a few logically organized commits by [squashing]() them. Do NOT squash file renames together with file edits. You will end up with lost ancestry history.
  * Someone else reviews & merges your (squashed) commit to origin/master.

Make sure you tested your changes and describe thoroughly what you changed.


## Versioning

Use use semantic versioning (semver) as described by [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning)


Thanks!
